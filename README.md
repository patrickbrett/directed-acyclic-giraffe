# directed-acyclic-giraffe
AI Arena 2021 Bot

## How to run

(instructions using pip3 / python3 as commands, replace with pip/python if that's what you have installed)

```bash
pip3 install ai-arena-21
aiarena21 the_giraffe_himself the_giraffe_himself
```

Our final bot that was used in the submission (which won 1st place) is 'the_giraffe_himself.py'. It has not been modified since the competition and should not be used as an example of general code cleanliness :)

All other bots we experimented with, many of which share characteristics with the final submission, can be found in the 'experimental_bots/' folder.

Competition instructions and info is in the instruction document provided (docs/DocV1.pdf)
